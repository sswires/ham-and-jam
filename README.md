Ham and Jam
===========

Here lies the unmodified source code of the ill-fated Ham and Jam mod for the Source engine. This source code has not been touched for some time but I find it interesting enough to upload. Some of the code will be a little rough as this is what I used to learn C++ around 8 years ago.

## RC1 Features
* 2 teams with 4 playable factions (British, Canadian, Polish and German)
* 16 weapons (2x Rifle, 4x SMG, 3x LMG, 4x Grenades, 3x Melee)
* 3 playable classes per team (Rifleman, Assault, Support)
* 6 levels set between 1940′s Norway, 1943 Italy and 1944 France
* 3 game modes (Attack & Defend, Push-Pull and Detonation)
* Prone, deploy anywhere bipods, squad LMG ammo drops and other interesting features.
